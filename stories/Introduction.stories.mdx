# AnnoREP Frontend

Anno-REP is an open-source, web-based tool that will help facilitate [Annotation for Transprent Inquiry (ATI)](https://qdr.syr.edu/ati) and other annotation-based workflows.
Please see this [document](https://github.com/QualitativeDataRepository/Anno-REP/blob/master/docs/index.md) for more information.

# Storybook

This App's documentation is developed using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org).

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.
